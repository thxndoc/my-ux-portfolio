            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>The South African taxi industry is an integral part of the country's transportation network. However, it is also an industry that relies heavily on cash transactions. This conceptual project will explore a cashless fare payment system.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container summary"> <!--Summary-->
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>The Cashless Fare Payment System is a conceptual project aimed at facilitating payment of fares by commuters utilizing minibus taxis. The payment process involves the use of an NFC-enabled tag, which is scanned by a validation device installed in the taxi. Commuters would have the option of loading and checking their account balance through an integrated USSD system linked to their bank, or through their respective banking app.

        After creating the affinity map and looking at the feedback, I came up with 2 archetypes:
        </p>

        <div class="wrapper">

                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="archetype-2">
                <h5>Convenience Seeking Commuter</h5>
                <p class="heading">Behaviour</p>

        </div>

        <p>How might we find a way to cut out time taken to go withdraw cash and for commuters to pay fares in a convenient and hassle-free way?</p>

        <div class="going-cashless">
            <h5>Going cashless</h5>
            <p>Going cashless has several benefits, such as increased convenience and reduced risk of theft. By using digital payment methods, people can make transactions quickly and easily, without the need for physical cash. This not only saves time, but also eliminates the hassle of carrying large amounts of money or having to visit an ATM. For taxi owners and drivers, there would be increased transparency as the money would be able to be tracked.</p>

        <p>After brainstorming, I decided not to go with an app. I chose something physical and small enough to carry wherever; <span class="highlight">a contactless payment tag, a validation machine and a USSD code.</span> This payment tag would have a hole to insert a keyring that could be attached to a lanyard.</p>

        <h5 class="heading two">Why?</h5>
        <p class="p1">A contactless payment tag would provide <span class="highlight">convenience</span> and <span class="highlight">user friendliness</span> for the commuter as there would be no need to take out a smartphone to pay and can be attached to a lanyard for ease of access. The validation device would be linked to the taxi owner's bank account and funds could be released at the end of each day.</p>

        <p>The USSD code system will provide <span class="hightlight">inclusion</span> to those who don't have a smartphone and will allow commuters to check and top-up their balance, eliminating the need to go to a kiosk.</p>

            </div>

            <p class="refine">From the feedback I received about the funds in the USSD system taking 2 business days to reflect, I decided to refine my concept and link the USSD system to the commuter's bank account. So instead of having a standalone USSD system, it would be integrated with the bank so that it would be similar to buying airtime or electricity.</p>

        <p class="heading">Conclusion</p>
        <p>This conceptual project was initiated because of my personal observation of the inefficiency and inconvenience of using cash as a mode of payment in minibus taxis. However, I acknowledge that if this were to be implemented as an actual project, it would involve multiple stakeholders and include a multitude of considerations and touchpoints. I recognize that an implementation of such a project would entail a significant amount of time, exceeding the duration of 8 weeks.</p>
